        <p> He's Been There Before by Elder Troy Whittle<br>
            The alarm bell rings at 6:30, I stumble to my feet<br>
            I grab my companions bedding and pull off his sheets<br>
            A groan fills the room, is it already time to arise?<br>
            It seems like just a second ago I was able to shut my eyes</p>

            <p>The morning activities follow- study, prayer and such<br>
                When it's time to leave the apartment, you feel you haven't accomplished much<br>
                "We have a super day planned," My comp. says with a grin<br>
                I lowly utter a faithless breath, "Yeah, if anyone lets us in."</p>

        <p>With the word of God and my faithful Schwinn, we ride off in the street prepared to<br>
            Face another day of humidity and heat<br>
            It's 9:30 in the evening, the day is almost through<br>
                My champion and I are riding home not accomplishing what we thought to do</p>

        <p>We ride up to the mailbox, hoping to receive a lot<br>
            Only to look inside and hear my echo reverberate "air Box"<br>
            We go up to our apartment, the day is now complete<br>
            The only thing to show for our work is a case of blistery feet</p>

        <p>It's past 10:30 p.m. My companion is fast asleep,<br>
            Silence engulfs me all about and I begin to weep<br>
            In the midst of sadness, I kneel down to pray<br>
            I need to talk to father, but I'm not sure what to say</p>

        <p>"Oh, Father" I begin, "What happened to us today?<br>
            I thought we'd teach somebody, but everyone was away<br>
            My hands, my aching hands- worn, hurt and beat;<br>
            If our area was any smaller, we'd have knocked every street"</p>

        <p>"Why on missions are the days so much alike?<br>
            The only difference about today was the flat tire on my bike<br>
            Will you send some cooler weather? The heat is killing me<br>
            I sweat so bad, it gets in my eyes, it's very hard to see"</p>

        <p>"Why do I have to wear a helmet, isn't your protection enough?<br>
            People always laugh at me, and call me stupid stuff<br>
            Please send us investigators so I may give them what they lack<br>
            I want to give them Books of Mormon, the weight of them hurts my back"</p>

        <p>"And what about my family: They don't have much to say<br>
            I'm sick of not hearing from home day after day after day<br>
            Oh Father, Why am I here am I just wasting time?<br>
            Sometimes I just want to go home, I'm sorry but that's on my mind"</p>

        <p>"My companion, Heavenly Father, what are you giving me?<br>
            "The way he rides his bicycle, I don't think he can see<br>
            Now you have it, I can't go on, I don't know what to do<br>
            That, my Father in Heaven, is the prayer I have for you"</p>

        <p>My prayer now finished, I stand up, then jump right into bed<br>
            I need my rest for tomorrow, we have another long day ahead<br>
            Sleep start to overtake me, I seem to drift away<br>
            Then it seems a vision takes me to another time in another day</p>

        <p>I'm standing alone on the hill. The view is very nice<br>
            A man walks to wards me and says, "My name is Jesus Christ"<br>
            Tears of joy well up inside, I fall down to His feet<br>
            "Arise," He states, "Follow me to the shade. You and I need to speak"</p>

        <p>My attention's towards my Savior, total and complete<br>
            He says, "Your mission is similar of what happened to me<br>
            I understand how you feel, I know what you're going through<br>
            In fact, it would be fair to say I've felt the same as you"</p>

        <p>"I even know how you felt when no one listened to you<br>
            At times I felt not quite sure what else I could do<br>
            I know you don't like to ride a bicycle, for you a car would be sweet<br>
            Just remember the donkey I rode wasn't equipped with 21 speeds"</p>

        <p>"I understand you don't like sweating, in fact it's something you hate<br>
            I remember when I sweat blood from evâ€™ry pore, oh the agony was great!<br>
            I see you don't like your companion- you'd rather have someone else-<br>
            I once had a companion named Judas who sold my life for wealth"</p>

        <p>"It's hard to wear a helmet and have people make fun of you<br>
            I remember when they put thorns on my head and called me King of the Jews<br>
            So you feel burdened down by the weight of your pack<br>
            I recall how heavy the cross was when they slammed it on my back"</p>


        <p>"Your hands hurt from tracting and knocking on doors all day<br>
            I guess when they pounded nails into mine, I ached in a similar way<br>
            It's hard not to hear from home when your family's not there to see<br>
            I lost communication on the cross and cried, "Father, why hast Thou forsaken me?"</p>

        <p>"We have a lot in common, but there's a difference between us you see<br>
            I endured to the end and finished my mission, so follow and do like me"<br><br>
            He embraced me with His arms and His light filled me with His love<br>
            With tears in my eyes I watched as He went back to the Father above</p>

        <p>I stood with awe and wonder when a beep rang in my head<br>
            I listened and heard the alarm, then realized I was in my bed<br>
            My companion let out a groan, "6:30 already, no way!"<br>
            I sat up and said, "Come on, I'll even carry your scriptures today!"</p>

        <p>No matter what we go through, when we feel we can't take more<br>
            Just stop and think about Jesus Christ, He's been there before<br>
