        <h2>Purpose of My Site</h2>-->
        <p>My proposal for my final project is to create a site to access some of my family's favorite recipes in an efficient, easy way. I want to have a search bar for my family members to be able to find recipies easily, and also have other functions such as a measurement converter and also a recipe resizer. For example, if my mom only wants to make a half recipe of bread, she can simply choose the option to half the recipe and my website will do that for her. To make a website like this has actually been a dream of mine for a few years now and I am so excited to be learning the skills neceessay to do it. I hope that my family will like my website and access it frequently.
        </p>
        <h2>Target Audience Description</h2>
        <p>My audience is older family members that know how to use the internet, but generally use paper recipes. I am trying to get them to use my website for all of their favorite recipes.
        </p>
        <h2>JSON</h2>
        <p>I will pull information for all content pages except for my homepage, including Breads, Desserts, Salads, Main Dish, and Snacks.</p>
        <h2>5 Content Pages</h2>
        <div class="content pages">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Page 1 - Home Page</h3><br> This Page will contain links to the other four pages and will be very graphical and pleasing to the user. It will contain a welcome message, and a featured or new recipe. It will have contact info for users to be able to suggest recipes for me to add.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Page 2 - Breads</h3><br> This page will be all of my family's favorite recipes for bread, roles, and pizza dough. This will include recipes with white flour, wheat flour, and sour dough. It will also have a JavaScript recipe re-sizer so my family and friends will be able to make exactly the amount of food they want.</li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Page 3 - Main Dish</h3><br> This page will contain recipes for my family's favorite dinner recipes. Growing up, my mother made a lot of casseroles, chiles, and soups, many of which will be represented on this page. One feature I will include is that the user will be able to choose exaclty how may servings of the dinner they want to make and the recipe will adjust accordingly.</li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Page 3 - Salads</h3><br> My wife loves eating healthy and everybody knows that eating healthy means eating salads, right!? This page will include recipes for a wide variety of salads, dips, and other healthy foods made from leafy greens. You want to look like Popeye don't you? So eat your spinach!</li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Page 4 - Snacks</h3><br> I love snacks. Just having something to munch on when I'm bored. This page will contain instrucions to make my favorite homemade snack foods. This will include homemade granola bars, muddy buddies, fruit leather, and fruit shakes!</li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Page 5 - Desserts</h3><br> This is my favorite part! If it wasn't for my wonderful wife, I would eat dessert instead of dinner! This page will have recipes for all different kinds of cookies, cakes, cobblers, and pies.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h1>Style</h1>
        <p>I plan on having a lot of white space on my page. I plan to have a fairly large apealing banner at the top of each page. The fonts will be frilly extravagant.
        </p>
