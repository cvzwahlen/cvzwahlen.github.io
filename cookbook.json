Punch down dough; divide and shape into 2 loaves. Place in prepared pans. Cover; let rise in warm place until light, 30 to 45 minutes. Heat oven to 350 F. Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until golden brown and loaves sound hollow when lightly tapped. Immediately remove from pans; cool.If desired, brush warm loaves with melted margarine or butter.

Cut into circles, about 6¾” diameter. While dough is still in bread machine, prepare the filling. Heat oil in skillet over medium hat. Add sausage. Cook, stirring frequently, until no longer pink. Combine sausage in a bowl, with pasta sauce, ricotta cheese and 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese. On one side of each dough circle, put a heaping ¼ cup of filling and 2 TB of Mozzarella cheese. Fold dough over filling; pinch edges to seal. A little water may help edge to seal. Place on greased baking sheet that has been sprinkled with cornmeal. Gently poke top of each calzone to create 2 steam vents. If desired, brush tops lightly with oil and sprinkle with garlic salt. Bake at 400 F. for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm with pizza sauce. NOTE: leftover filling tastes great as a burrito filling in a flour tortilla. Brush lightly with melted butter and bake at 400 degrees about 8 minutes, till crispy and golden."
